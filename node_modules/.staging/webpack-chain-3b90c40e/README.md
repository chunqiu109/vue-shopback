Use a chaining API to generate and simplify the modification of
webpack version 2-4 configurations.

This documentation corresponds to v6 of webpack-chain. For previous versions, see:

* [v5 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v5)
* [v4 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v4)
* [v3 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v3)
* [v2 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v2)
* [v1 docs](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v1)

_Note: while webpack-chain is utilized extensively in Neutrino, this package is
completely standalone and can be used by any project._

## Introduction

webpack's core configuration is based on creating and modifying a
potentially unwieldy JavaScript object. While this is OK for configurations
on individual projects, trying to share these objects across projects and
make subsequent modifications gets messy, as you need to have a deep
understanding of the underlying object structure
